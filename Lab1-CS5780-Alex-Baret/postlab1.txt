1) What are the GPIO control registers that the lab mentions? Briefly describe each of their functions.
 -> MODER: Used to select the I/O mode (input, output, AF, analog)
 -> OTYPER: Used to select the output type (push-pull or open-drain)
 -> OSPEEDR: Used to select the speed (low,medium,high)
 -> PUPDR: Used to select the pull-up/pull-down whatever the I/O direction
 
 2) What values would you want to write to the bits controlling a pin in the GPIOx_MODER register in order to set it to analog mode?
